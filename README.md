#Introduction
Welcome to the "Student Exam Performance Indicator" ML project repository! This project aims to develop a predictive model to assess and predict students' exam performance based on various input features. The goal is to enable educators and administrators to make data-driven decisions and implement targeted interventions to improve student outcomes.

#Project Overview
In this project, we focused on developing a predictive model using multiple regression models, such as Random Forest, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). We performed hyperparameter tuning to optimize the models for improved accuracy. Additionally, we used a comprehensive dataset, conducted data preprocessing tasks, and evaluated the models using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared.

#Technologies Used
Python
Jupyter Notebook
Data Structures
Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)
#Project Description
The "Student Exam Performance Indicator" project is designed to analyze and predict students' exam performance based on various factors such as previous exam scores, study time, attendance, and socio-economic factors. By understanding the relationships between these features and the final exam performance, educators and administrators can gain valuable insights to implement targeted interventions and improve overall student outcomes.

Data Science Techniques
In this project, we applied the following Data Science techniques:

Data Cleaning: Removing duplicates, handling missing values, and ensuring data consistency.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing and visualizing the dataset to gain insights into feature distributions and relationships.
Data Preprocessing: Scaling features, encoding categorical variables, and splitting data into training and testing sets.
Multiple Regression Models: Utilizing Random Forest, SVR, and KNN to build predictive models for student exam performance.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model hyperparameters to achieve better accuracy.
Model Evaluation: Using metrics like MSE, MAE, and R-squared to assess the performance of each model.
Model Evaluation
After training the models, we evaluated their performance using various metrics to compare their effectiveness. This evaluation process helped us select the most suitable model for predicting student exam performance.

Usage
